            <li><p><a href="http://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a><br/>
                W3Schools is a great resource as an introduction to nearly all things needed to know in order to author good web pages. This is valued because there are a lot of tutorials and examples of web languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, JSON, and Node. Anyone working on the web will find this a valuable resource for authoring web apps. I can use this site as a resource to look up the things I need as well as working through tutorials to learn new things, as well as refreshing what I have forgotten.<br/>

            <li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a><br/>
                StackOverflow has a reputation for being an often-consulted programmer's resource. If you've run into a problem during programming, there's a good chance someone else has experienced the exact same issue, and an even greater chance that they posted a query about it to the StackOverflow QnA section. All in all a great knowledge base that should be utilized by anyone looking for outside input, but all advice should be taken with a grain of salt and applied to your own knowledge.<br/>

            <li><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a><br/>
                Udemy is an excellent online course aggregate with tutorials for almost any imaginable subject. Once a course is purchased, you can learn at your own pace and the video lectures are a good resource that you can refer to whenever you are having an issue. Sales occur relatively frequently and it is possible to pick up relevant courses for very cheap. However, you should be aware that while there is a large breadth of topics available, more specific niches (especially in programming) do not have lectures.<br/>

            <li><p><a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda/LinkedinLearning</a><br/>
                Lynda, like Udemy, is another online course aggregate with a very good reputation. It also lets you learn at your own pace with video and exercise tutorials, but has a much wider range of programming courses than Udemy at first glance, and has C#, Node, SQL, and Javascript tutorials that will all get you started along the right path to developing functional websites and applications.<br/>

            <li><p><a href="https://b-ok.cc/">Z-Library</a><br/>
                Z-library is an interesting case. It hosts no content of its own, but is an archival site for any and all print material. This means that yes, it will likely have that textbook you paid $100 to pre-order from the BC bookstore. The site is useful for much more than simply saving money, though. The programming textbooks available span every discipline and language, making it an easy first stop for anyone looking for comprehensive knowledge. Just make sure that the textbooks are up to date.<br/>
